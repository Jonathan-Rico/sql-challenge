# sql-challenge
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), our first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
Using MySQL, we designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database.
For the data analysis, we performed the following in our SQL queries:

1- Listed the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2- Listed the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3- Listed the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4- Listed the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5- Listed first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6- Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7- Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8- Listed the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
